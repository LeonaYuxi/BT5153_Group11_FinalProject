This project presents a study on sentiment analysis of individual investors’ comments and professionals’ opinions from Investing.com from January 1st, 2022, to February 24th, 2023, and their impact on stock prices. 

The whole projects can be divided into 4 parts: EDA, Sentiment Analyisis, Statistical Modeling and LSTM for Stock Prediction.

In Part 1, the code aims to perform exploratory data analysis by generating the number of individual investors' comments and professional opinions for each stock, creating word clouds for both types of texts, and conducting a statistical summary of the sentiment analysis results. We run file “BT5153_finan_project_EDA.ipynb”, other files in folder are input datasets for this ipynb file.

In Part 2. Sentiment Prediction, we run file “BT5153_sentiment_0422.ipynb”, other files in folder are input datasets for this ipynb file.

In Part 3. Statistical Modeling, we run file “regression.ipynb”, other files in folder are input dataset for this ipynb file.

In Part 4. LSTM for Stock Prediction, we run file “BT5153_final_project_Part_4_LSTM.ipynb”, other files in folder are input dataset for this ipynb file.
